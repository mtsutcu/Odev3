Welcome to the final and greatest challenge of the War of the Ring, set in the apocalyptic Middle-earth. On the one hand, the ring bearer Frodo and his companion Sam, guided by the unreliable Gollum, attempt to reach Mordor and take the One Ring to the only place where they can destroy it. On the other hand, Gandalf, Aragorn, and our other friends, who had defeated Saruman by joining forces with the Horsemen of Rohan and the Ents, must arrive and defend Gondor under the threat of the Dark Lord. Gondor's defense will no doubt be no easier than the Battle of Helm's Deep. For Sauron's armies are already on the move. If they succeed in doing so, it is clear that Gondor will be a true King of the blood of Isuldur, and the King will face even more fierce battles than any before.
